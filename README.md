S.O.P.H.I.A. (Safety Officer Personalised Health Intelligence Assistant) is an real-time monitoring system that analyzes dynamic household living data to evoke a cost-efficient and effective response. It aims to call upon early intervention actions as soon as possible to reduce further risks of the vulnerable population and to ease the operating workload of SCDF officers.

### What's the problem? 

Problem Statement Chosen: Emergency Medical Services

A bulk of SCDF's inbound calls are related to the Emergency Medical Services. At a staggering number of 191,468 calls (~98% of Total calls; where Total calls = EMS + Fire Incidents), our team decide to create a solution around EMS to ease SCDF's operating workload. Calls which involved the elderly population attributed to 43.8% of total EMS calls. This is no surprise as Singapore is currently experiencing an upward trending growth in the aging population. 

### How can technology help?

Schools and teachers can continue to engage with their students through virtual classrooms, and even create interactive spaces for classes. As parents face a new situation where they may need to homeschool their children, finding appropriate online resources is important as well.

### The idea

It's imperative that learning and creating can continue when educational institutions have to shift the way they teach in times of crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Providing a set of open source tools, backed by IBM Cloud and Watson Services, will enable educators to more easily make content available for their students.
