# Kerby-S.O.P.H.I.A._SCDFXIBM
S.O.P.H.I.A. (Safety Officer Personalised Health Intelligence Assistant) is an real-time monitoring system that analyzes dynamic household living data to evoke a cost-efficient and effective response. It aims to call upon early intervention actions as soon as possible to reduce further risks of the vulnerable population and to ease the operating workload of SCDF officers.

### What's the problem? 

Problem Statement Chosen: Emergency Medical Services

A bulk of SCDF's inbound calls are related to the Emergency Medical Services. At a staggering number of 191,468 calls (~98% of Total calls; where Total calls = EMS + Fire Incidents), our team decide to create a solution around EMS to ease SCDF's operating workload. Calls which involved the elderly population attributed to 43.8% of total EMS calls. This is no surprise as Singapore is currently experiencing an upward trending growth in the aging population. A portion of the aging population are "vulnerable populations" (e.g. without a next of kin), which highlights an emergence of higher risk within households.

### How can technology help?

By capturing data of household and homeowner activity, we are able to monitor the baseline patterns during normal times. If there is a divergence from such normality an investigative procedure will be performed, depending on the severity of the divergence. With a well connected infrastructure, the system is able to find appropriate measures for self-aid resources or to alert Community First Responders (CFRs) to enlist their help. 

In non-severe cases, the situation will be highlighted to the relevant parties (e.g. next-of-kin, CFR, social workers). They can then act as an early intervention measure to prevent the escalation of injury/accident risk. In highly severe cases, the system will inform the SCDF or other relevant organisations for immediate attention. 

The aim of this solution is to utlize technology:
1. To analyze the status quo of a given household via data analysis
2. To prevent a high-risk situation by creating opportunities for early intervention as early as possible
3. To remedy different situations with different level of support based on severity

### The idea

In view of the growth in the aging population, it is important that we have to create a safer household for everyone so that their needs are met and they are well supported at all times. This is especially significant in times of crises such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. During our nation's circuit breaker, social interaction is reduced and this poses a huge problem for the aging households without a next-of-kin. In such households, when a high-risk event happens it might already be too late.
